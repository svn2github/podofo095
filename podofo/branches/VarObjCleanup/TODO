    - Do not inherit from PdfTokenizer

FUTURE
    - PdfString needs to handle (optionally?) encoding & decoding of Unicode strings
    - More filters (read & write)
    - Content stream parsing
    - Support for attaching an ICC profile to an image or content stream
    - Support for reading & writing encrypted PDFs
    - Some more drawing routines (tiles, save and rstore?) also finish cleanup
      the existing ones revamp color support to be more general & support more
      types
    - Interactive forms support
    - PNG predictor functions in filters
    - CMYK image handling for podofoimgextract, images in different colour
      spaces in general.
    - Delay resource acquisition for PdfInputDevice until required to support
      its use as a delayed stream source without holding too many open files.
