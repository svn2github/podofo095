1. What is PoDoFo?
==================

PoDoFo is a library to work with the PDF file format and includes also a few
tools. The name comes from the first letter of PDF (Portable Document
Format). 

The PoDoFo library is a free portable C++ library which includes
classes to parse a PDF file and modify its contents into memory. The changes
can be written back to disk easily. The parser could also be used to write a
PDF viewer. Besides parsing PoDoFo includes also very simple classes to create
your own PDF files. All classes are documented so it is easy to start writing
your own application using PoDoFo.

The PoDoFo tools are simple tools build around the PoDoFo library. These tools
are first of all examples on how to use the PoDoFo library in your own
projects. But secondly they offer also features for working with PDF
files. More tools will come with future release and the existing tools will
gain more features. Currently there are two tools: podofoimgextract (which
extracts all jpeg images from a given PDF file) and podofouncompress (which
removes all compression filters from a PDF file - this is useful for debugging
existing PDF files).

Additionally there is the external tool PoDoFoBrowser which is not included in
this package, but can be downloaded from the PoDoFo webpage. PoDoFoBrowser is
a Qt application for browsing the objects in a PDF file and modifying their
keys easily. It is very useful if you want to look on the internal structure
of PDF files.

As of now PoDoFo is only available for Unix platforms. But the code is
portable C++ and a Windows version will be available soon.
