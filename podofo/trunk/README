1. What is PoDoFo?
==================

PoDoFo is a library to work with the PDF file format and includes also a few
tools. The name comes from the first letter of PDF (Portable Document
Format). 

The PoDoFo library is a free portable C++ library which includes
classes to parse a PDF file and modify its contents into memory. The changes
can be written back to disk easily. The parser could also be used to write a
PDF viewer. Besides parsing PoDoFo includes also very simple classes to create
your own PDF files. All classes are documented so it is easy to start writing
your own application using PoDoFo.

The PoDoFo tools are simple tools build around the PoDoFo library. These tools
are first of all examples on how to use the PoDoFo library in your own
projects. But secondly they offer also features for working with PDF
files. More tools will come with future release and the existing tools will
gain more features. The following tools are currently available: 
* podofoimgextract (which extracts all jpeg images from a given PDF file) 
* podofouncompress (which removes all compression filters from a PDF file - this is useful for debugging
existing PDF files).
* podofopdfinfo (provides some basic info about a PDF - metadata, page details, etc.)
* podofotxt2pdf (converts a text file to a PDF)

Additionally there is the external tool PoDoFoBrowser which is not included in
this package, but can be downloaded from the PoDoFo webpage. PoDoFoBrowser is
a Qt application for browsing the objects in a PDF file and modifying their
keys easily. It is very useful if you want to look on the internal structure
of PDF files.

As of now PoDoFo is available for Unix, Mac OS X and Windows platforms. 

2. Where can I can get it?
==========================

PoDoFo is available on the internet: podofo.sf.net

3. Requirements
===============

To build PoDoFo lib you need besides a working GNU toolchain (Unix) and a c++
compiler or Visual Studio 7.x (Windows) as well as the following libraries:

- fontconfig (Unix only)
- freetype2
- zlib
- libjpeg

4. Installation
===============

Installation should be done on any Unix system with the following commands:

make -f Makefile.svn  (only required when building from svn)
./configure
make
su
make install

On Windows, use the provided Visual Studio Solution/Project files after
placing the other libraries in a directory inside of the podofo directory,
though support for generating project files with CMake is now available
(see below).

An XCode project is provided for Mac OS X users.

4.1 Installation with CMake
===========================

PoDoFo now has experimental support for builds using CMake on all supported
platforms. The CMake build has been tested on:

	- Visual C++ 8 Express Edition [Win32] ("Visual Studio 8 2005" target)
	- MinGW with GCC 3.4.2 [Win32] ("MinGW Makefiles" target)
	- gcc 3.3.5 [Linux: Debian 3.1] ("Unix Makefiles" target)

The CMake build system may become the primary/only build system if testing is
successful and feedback is good. As the use of CMake will simplify build system
maintainance considerably, comments, problem reports, etc would be strongly
appreciated.

You can use the CMake variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to control the type of
build. The main values supported are DEBUG and RELEASE. The default is
DEBUG. Set the build type with the CMake argument:
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
		or
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
as appropriate.

All instructons below use out-of-tree builds (recommended). To clean up an
out-of-tree build, just delete the build directory.

On all Makefile-style builds, set the VERBOSE flag to 1 on the make command
line to see all compiler commands etc.

4.1.1 CMake builds on Linux/UNIX
================================

Linux and UNIX users should be able to build PoDoFo by cd'ing into the PoDoFo
checkout or unpacked tarball directory (here assumed to be named "podofo-src")
and:

mkdir ../podofo-build
cd ../podofo-build
cmake -G "UNIX Makefiles" ../podofo-src
make

To see detailed compiler output, use:

make VERBOSE=1

instead of just "make".

[The experimental CMake builds do not yet support "make install"]

If you need to specify additional paths to search for libraries, set the
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables or set them on
the command line:

cmake -G "UNIX Makefiles" ../podofo-src \
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/sfw/include \
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sfw/lib

If you wish to generate only a static library or only a shared library, set the
PODOFO_BUILD_SHARED and/or PODOFO_BUILD_STATIC flags:

cmake -G "UNIX Makefiles" ../podofo-src \
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/sfw/include \
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sfw/lib \
	-DPODOFO_BUILD_SHARED=TRUE \
	-DPODOFO_BUILD_STATIC=FALSE

By default, all supported library types will be built where possible (with older
CMake versions you might need to build either the static or shared library,
not both).

Note that the instructions above run an out-of-tree build. CMake does support
in-tree builds, but the use of out-of-tree builds is very strongly recommended.

If your system has gcc 4, consider adding the argument
-DPODOFO_USE_VISIBILITY=1 . This will enable gcc4's limited symbol visibility
support, reducing the PoDoFo binary size dramatically and improve link times.

4.1.2 CMake builds on Windows
=============================

Building CMake on Windows can be done using MinGW (a minimalist gcc-based
compliler environment for Windows) or Visual Studio. Other methods may work but
have not been tested.

Because the C++ ABIs of most of the win32 compilers are incompatible, you must
build PoDoFo with the same compiler and version that you will use to build the
programs linked to PoDoFo. Failure to follow this restriction will result in
link errors at best, and bizarre runtime failures at worst.

On Windows, if you are linking against a shared (DLL) build of PoDoFo you
MUST define the preprocessor macro USING_SHARED_PODOFO when including any
podofo headers. Failure to do so will result in link time and/or runtime errors.

On Windows, PoDoFo may be built as either a shared or static library. Building
both is not supported. By default only the shared library will be built. If you
want a static library, just disable generation of the shared library with the
extra argument to cmake:

	-DPODOFO_BUILD_SHARED=FALSE

4.1.2.1 CMake builds on Windows with MinGW
==========================================

MinGW builds are essentially the same as the UNIX instructions above, but
Windows-style paths should be used. Make sure that the MinGW "bin"
directory is on your PATH, and be sure to set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH such that CMake can find the headers and libraries that
PoDoFo requires. The GnuWin32 library packages from http://gnuwin32.sf.net/
are known to work.

md ..\podofo-debug
cd ..\podofo-debug
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..\podofo-src -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\include -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\lib
mingw32-make

One of the easiest ways to get MinGW is as part of the Qt4 package from
Trolltech.

4.1.2.1 CMake builds on Windows with Visual Studio
==================================================

A Visual Studio build requires that Microsoft Visual Studio be installed.
Visual Studio 8 2005 Express Edition is known to work, and is a free download
from Microsoft. The visual studio build has two stages - first, CMake is used
to generate a Visual Studio solution:

md ..\podofo-debug
cd ..\podofo-debug
cmake -G "Visual Studio 8 2005" ..\podofo-src -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\include -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\lib
podofo.sln

... and build the solution when it opens in Visual Studio.

Note that CMake should automatically find your Visual Studio install, so you
shouldn't need any special settings unless you have an unusual setup.

You can get the Visual C++ Express Edition from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/ .

4.1.2.1 CMake builds on Windows with NMake
==========================================

PoDoFo can also be built with NMake. The build procedure is essentially the same
as described for MinGW or Visual Studio, but you must use the target name
"NMake Makefiles" and run "nmake" after CMake completes.

Getting your environment set up correctly for NMake can be tricky. The author of
this section is no expert, but has had success running the Windows 2003 SDK
environment file first, followed by the Visual Studio vcvars.bat file. If something
goes wrong clean your build directory before trying again.
