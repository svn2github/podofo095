    - Content stream parsing
    - Support for attaching an ICC profile to an image or content stream
    - PdfWriter should be able to write objects immediately and not keep all in
      memory first (ie stream-oriented writing)
      -and/or-
    - Deferred and possibly progressive stream loading during document-write
      out to save memory (ie deferred writing)
    - Support for reading & writing encrypted PDFs
    - Some more drawing routines (tiles, save and rstore?) also finish cleanup
      the existing ones revamp color support to be more general & support more
      types
    - Interactive forms support
    - PNG predictor functions in filters
    - CMYK image handling for podofoimgextract, images in different colour

    - Delay resource acquisition for PdfInputDevice until required to support
      its use as a delayed stream source without holding too many open files.
