NOW:
	- PdfPainter should make sure that a stream is decompressed before
	drawing so that it can work on any PdfPage object (even existing ones)
	- PdfSharedBuffer and a 4096 byte buffer for the parser shared with
	all PdfParserObjects to make parsing faster (also use this buffer in PdfStreams)	
	


PoDoFo 0.3 
       - PdfWebWriter who creates linearized PDF files
       - Some more drawing routines (tiles, save and rstore?)
       - PdfWriter should be able to write objects immediately
         and not keep all in memory first.
       - PdfParser should return more information (i.e. vector of all pages
       and a reference to the PageTree)
       - introduce PdfArray and PdfDictionary classes
       - Add configure checks for zlib, freetype and fontconfig
       - PdfPage should use PdfObject::GetParent instead of having an own one
       - PdfVecObject should be able to have a PdfDocument as parent so that
       PdfPage does not need to keep a PdfDocument pointer.
