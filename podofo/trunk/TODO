PoDoFo 0.3 
       - PdfWebWriter who creates linearized PDF files
       - Support for reading & writing encrypted PDFs
       - Some more drawing routines (tiles, save and rstore?)
       		also finish cleanup the existing ones
       		revamp color support to be more general & support more types
       - PdfWriter should be able to write objects immediately
         and not keep all in memory first.
       - Add configure checks for zlib, freetype and fontconfig
       - PdfString needs to handle (optionally?) encoding & decoding of Unicode strings
       
FUTURE
	- Garbage Collected save (renumber objects to remove unused ones)
	- More filters (read & write)
	- Content stream parsing
