	<h2>PodofoImpose</h2>
	<div id="intro">PodofoImpose is a utility program which aims to provide a rather simple way to impose PDF documents. Originally written for my own use, it ended up in PoDoFo release as a show-case (don’t rely too much on it).
	</div>
	
	<h3>Plan</h3>
	<div class="section"><!-- Plan -->
		PodofoImpose is driven by a PLAN file. This file describes how pages from a source PDF document have to be relayout into a target document. We’ll describe how this file must be formated.
		<h4>Records</h4>
		<div>
			Most of the PLAN file is composed of record lines of the form:
			<div class="code-abs">
				source page; target page; rotation; horizontal translation; vertical translation;
			</div>
			Each element of the record can be a numeric value, a constant or an expression involving both numerics and constants.
		</div>
		<h4>Constants</h4>
		<div>
			Constants can be  declared everywhere in the PLAN file except in loops. They are 8 bits char strings (except "=") with a leading "$" character which makes them easy to identify. Their value is always interpreted as a float through std::atof. You can "overload" a constant value by redeclaring it. They are declared in this form:
			<div class="code-abs">
				$MyConstant=123.456
			</div>
			Note that a PLAN file is valid only if it contains 2 required constants which are "$PageWidth" and "$PageHeight", giving target document dimensions.
		</div>
		<h4>Expressions</h4>
		<div>
			An expression is a set of basic mathematic operations +, -, * and /. Operations are executed from left to right without taking care of any kind of precedance. You can use parenthesis to enclose operations that need to be computed separetly. Example:
			<div class="code-abs">
				123.456 * ( $ConstantA - ( $ConstantB / 3.14 ) )
			</div>
		</div>
		<h4>Loops</h4>
		<div>
			Loops allow users to programmatically generate records. While the concept itself is familiar to programmers I can imagine that regular users would feel not so easy with it. So let me introduce a simple example to explain the thing.
		</div>
		<div>
			Let say we have a source document, A4 format, which has 1000 pages and we just want to position each page on the center of an A3 plate.
			<div class="file">
				<div class="name">A4onA3.plan</div>
				<div class="content">$PageWidth=842.6 
$PageHeight=1195.2
## SourceWidth &#38; SourceHeight
$sw=597.6
$sh=842.4
$page=1
@1000($page+1)
$page; $page; 0; ($PageWidth-$sw)/2; ($PageHeight-$sh)/2;
@</div>	
			</div>
			The loop is what’s enclosed by "@" characters, the second just indicates the end of the loop. The first first indicates how many iterations (loops) have to be performed &#8212; 1000 here. Then comes the interesting part, constants which appear in parenthesis will be incremented by the value following the "+" (can be a minus one, in that case don’t turn the "+" into a "-", just prefix the value with "-" as in ($foo+-1.23)), which means in this example that at each iteration, $page will see its value increased by 1.
		</div>
		<div>
			Constants (which finally turn into variables ;-)) must be declared before the loop. Many constants can be put in loop declaration, separate them with semicolons.
		</div>
		<div>
			No, loops can’t be nested!
		</div>
		<h4>Running</h4>
		<div>
		Once you’ve wrote the PLAN file you can run the program: 
			<div class="command">
				podofoimpose source.pdf target.pdf plan.plan
			</div>
		Note the source can be either a PDF file or a text file which is a listing of PDF files
		</div>
        </div> <!-- Plan -->
	
	<h3>Examples</h3>
	<div class="section"><!-- Examples -->
	<h5>Add a stamp to a document</h5>
	Shame on me, don’t even have a real stamp at my "office". So I tried something and it worked! Say you have that official one page A4 doc, named official.pdf, on which you want to add a nice stamp. You have your stamp in the file stamp.pdf. You first have to create two files:
	<div class="file">
		<div class="name">
		pdf.list
		</div>
		<div class="content">official.pdf
stamp.pdf</div>
	</div>
	<div class="file">
		<div class="name">stamponator.plan</div>
<div class="content">$PageWidth=597.6 
$PageHeight=842.4
# original page is left unchanged;
1; 1; 0; 0; 0;
# positionning stamp is up to you!
2; 1; 0; 350; 100;</div>
	</div>
	Now you can run:
	<div class="command">podofoimpose  pdf.list stamped-official.pdf stamponator.plan</div>

	<h5>Make a tiled poster</h5>
	<div>
		Printing a large graphic onto a set of little paper sheets can be handful. Doing it automatically is even better! You can find files used in this example here: <a href="poster.pdf">poster.pdf</a>,
							 <a href="poster_mask.pdf">poster_mask.pdf</a>,
							  <a href="poster.plan">poster.plan</a> and 
							  <a href="poster.list">poster.list</a>. Here constants are a bit abbreviated in order to fit in the frame.
		<div class="file">
			<div class="name">poster.plan</div>
			<div class="content"># source is A1 doc
