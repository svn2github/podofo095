The Qt4 port of PoDoFoBrowser is best built with CMake. You will need 
at least CMake 2.5.x, currently only available from CMake CVS. PoDoFo must have
been built with CMake.

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
	-DPoDoFo_DIRECTORY=/path/to/podofo_build_dir \
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/extra/includes \
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/extra/libraries \

Windows users can also build PoDoFoBrowser using CMake. You will need
a PoDoFo build tree and an installed copy of Qt4. Set QTDIR to point to your
Qt install directory, ensure MinGW is on your PATH, and make sure to set
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the same libraries
you used to build PoDoFo against (important!).

SET QTDIR=c:\qt\4.2.1
SET PATH=c:\mingw\bin;%PATH%
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
	-DPoDoFo_DIRECTORY=c:\developer\podofo_build_dir
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\include
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\lib

The open source version of Qt4 does not support building with Visual Studio.
PoDoFoBrowser should build fine with CMake and Visual Studio if you are using
a version of Qt that supports this configuration. Please report any issues with
this process, as the authors do not have easy access to this configuration.

Note that PoDoFoBrowser currently only builds against a PoDoFo build tree,
not an installed copy of the library.

You may also be able to build PoDoFoBrowser with qmake, but this is neither
well tested nor really supported.

	qmake
	make
	su
	make install
