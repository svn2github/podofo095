PoDoFoBrowser is a Qt 4 application for browsing the objects in a PDF file and
modifying their keys easily. It is very useful if you want to look on the
internal structure of PDF files.

You will need Qt4 and PoDoFo to build PoDoFoBrowser. QMake is used as the build
system. You will need to modify podofobrowser.pro to reflect local paths
to required include files and libraries on your system before attempting
to build PoDoFoBrowser.
